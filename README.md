## Hi, I’m Volkan 👋

I’m a crazy maker who solves problems and occasionally creates some. 

The context, the origin, or the nature of those problems are orthogonal to the approaches I take in solving them.

I’m simplistic, pragmatic, and (*mostly*) to the point 🙃.

## Zero To Hero

I have moved most of my repositories from my personal GitHub to [**Zero to Hero** GitHub Organization][z2h].

If you want to see a sample of my source code and contributions, [**Zero to Hero** GitHub Organization][z2h] could be a good place to start.

## Thanks

That’s about it.

Never stop asking, always be learning… And may the source be with you 🖖.
